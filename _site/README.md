# Todo
- Add TIL category
- [Update profile with github actions](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/)
- Once I have a handful of posts:
  - Setup something for categories
  - Add TIL category
  - If I end up having enough "real" blog posts
    - Add separate TIL page
