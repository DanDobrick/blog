This post will be about how I've expierenced working at a large prestigous copany like Shopify. While tehre ARE a lot of REALLY REALLY smart people, the average engineer here is just as capable as the average engineer anywhere else I've worked.

I'll also talk about my expierence with AI. autocomplete will never go away; it's a super power and works pretty well. Chatting with Cursor can be really hit-and-miss. I've been trying to work with it to do some of the more mundane tasks like writing tests or removing fully ramped feature flags and I spend more time fixing the problems it creates than I saved by using cursor rather than writing it myself.
