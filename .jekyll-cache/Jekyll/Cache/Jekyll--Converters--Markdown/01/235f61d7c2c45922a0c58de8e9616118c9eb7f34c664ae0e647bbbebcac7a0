<p>PostgreSQL offers a few comparison functions that are very useful if your table has columns that require exactly one entry. I ran into a situation recently that utilized the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num_nonnulls</code> function combined with a DB constraint to ensure that only one of a group of tables had data.</p>
