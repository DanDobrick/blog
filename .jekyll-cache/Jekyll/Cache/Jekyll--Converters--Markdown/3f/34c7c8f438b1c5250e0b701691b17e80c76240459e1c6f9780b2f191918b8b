<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On March 07, 2019 Red Hat &amp; the JBoss Community announced Quarkus. It is a Java framework that enables ultra low
boot
times and tiny
memory footprint for applications and services. It does that by taking advantage of GraalVM's native compilation
capabilities to produce an executable out of your Java code. Why is this considered to be a game
changer ?
In this article I will give my view and first impressions on this framework as someone who spends
a bit of time writing applications and services. I will get my hands dirty by building a
working Quarkus + Apache Camel example.
