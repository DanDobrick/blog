I"–<p>Recently I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0p7pWSxOXw">this video</a> from RubyConf 2018 about dotfiles and decided to customize my own setup across the computers I use daily (a personal Macbook, a work Macbook and a personal Linux server). If youâ€™re not familiar with the concept of dotfiles, Iâ€™d watch the first few minutes of that video before continuing to read this post.</p>
