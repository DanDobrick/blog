I"ù<p>Recently I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0p7pWSxOXw">this video</a> from RubyConf 2018 about dotfiles and decided to customize my own setup across the 3 computers I use daily (personal Macbook, work Macbook and personal Linux server). If youâ€™re not familiar with the concept of dotfiles, Iâ€™d watch the first few minutes of that video before continuing to read this post.</p>

<p>I was introduced to dotfiles was in bootcamp where one of the instructors gave us all a copy of their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> which contained a few ruby-based aliases and a nice shell prompt showing the current git branch. Prior to watching this video I had literally copy/pasted that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> onto multiple computers and had no idea how much of it worked. That RubyConf video convinced me that Iâ€™m missing out on some cool stuff and should probably figure out how to tweak things for myself.</p>

<h2 id="zsh">Zsh</h2>
<p>Because I was already going to screw with my shell I decided to change everything and move from using bash to using <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">Z shell</a>(zsh) and <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. Zsh has some cool features that Iâ€™m not gonna go over, but I wanted to talk about some of my zsh-specific dotfiles</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to dl and install</li>
  <li>r10k</li>
  <li>mention a few things in zshrc</li>
</ul>

<p>The very first thing I did was to check out what dotfiles I currently had and what they all were doing; luckily I only really had configuration in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bash_profile</code> and global gitconfig(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.gitconfig</code>). Next I backed up my bash profile and replaced it with an empty file</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mv</span> ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.backup
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">touch</span> ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre></div></div>
