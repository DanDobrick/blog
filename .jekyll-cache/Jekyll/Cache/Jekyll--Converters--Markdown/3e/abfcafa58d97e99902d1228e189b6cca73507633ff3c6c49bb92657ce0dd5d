I"x<p>Recently I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0p7pWSxOXw">this video</a> from RubyConf 2018 about dotfiles and decided to customize my own setup across the computers I use daily (a personal Macbook, a work Macbook and a personal Linux server). If you’re not familiar with the concept of dotfiles, I’d watch the first few minutes of that video before continuing to read this post.

<p>I broke this post up into the various different things I changed or started using:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#my_background">My background with Dotfiles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#zsh">Using ZSH + iTerm</a></li>
  <li><a href="#rcm">Using RCM and storing dotfiles in github</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dotfiles">Specific Dotfiles</a></li>
  <li><a href="#update_scripts">Update scripts</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-background">My Background</h2>
<p>I was introduced to dotfiles in bootcamp where one of the instructors gave us a copy of their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code>, which contained some aliases and a nice shell prompt showing the current git branch and current directory. Prior to watching this video I had literally copy/pasted that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> onto multiple computers and had no idea how much of it worked. This caused me to accidentally break things when adding/removing aliases to my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> and generally made me scared of bash in general. Watching that video convniced me to learn how all this worked and tweak things how <em>I</em> like them rather than how a DBC instructuor set their machine up.</p>

<h2 id="zsh">Zsh</h2>
<p>Because I was already going to screw with my shell I decided to change everything and move from using bash to using <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">Z shell</a>(zsh) and <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. Zsh has some cool features that I’m not gonna go over, but I wanted to talk about some of my zsh-specific dotfiles</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to dl and install</li>
  <li>r10k</li>
  <li>mention a few things in zshrc</li>
</ul>

<p>The very first thing I did was to check out what dotfiles I currently had and what they all were doing; luckily I only really had configuration in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.bash_profile</code> and global gitconfig(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.gitconfig</code>). Next I backed up my bash profile and replaced it with an empty file</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">mv</span> ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.backup
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">touch</span> ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre></div></div>
