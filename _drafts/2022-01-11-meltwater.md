# Meltwater

Today I’m talking about Meltwater: a Game of Tactical Starvation, designed by Erin Escobedo and published by [Hollandspiele](). I picked up this game during the last Hollandays sale which was the final chance to get the game from Hollandspiele as the game is going to a larger publisher at some point in the future.

Because it was the last chance to get this game from Hollandspiele they sold a BUNCH of copies and ran out of the black disks that normally come with the game and I got these yellow disks, which work well enough, but I may order some black disks in the future and play with those. It looks way more ominous like those hexes really are “dead”.
<my game>

This is a written version of the video I published here
<EMBED VIDEO>

## Overview
Meltwater is set in Antarctica after a nuclear war in an unknown year of the 20th century. To quote the rulebook

<block quote>
“The unthinkable finally happens. The world is scoured clean in nuclear fire. The oceans are poisoned for generations to come. One last patch of habitable land remains: Antarctica. The remnants of humanity huddle together in a fragile patchwork of research stations and
refugee ships. But even here, the Cold War survives. And our civilization may not”
<end block quote>

The goal of the game is to “Annihilate the enemy”, to have the literal last unit standing. The rules also clarify that you win the moment your opponent has zero units on the board 

<Rulebook shot>
“even if your units would be doomed to death later in the same turn. With your last breath, spit on your enemy’s grave”

Combine this with the quote from Gen. Thomas Power (an AirForce general during the cold war) that opens the rulebook and you’re setup for a bleak time:
“Restraint? Why are you so concerned with saving their lives? The whole idea is to kill the bastards. At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian left alive, we win.”

I’ll come back to this brutal sentiment at the end of the video, but for now let’s talk about the game.

<My face shot>
Hollandspiele describes the weight as <SOMETHING>, whatever that means, but I would agree with BGG that Meltwater is a medium-light game. The rules are simple, and the game plays pretty quickly so it’s perfect for when my wife and I have less motivation to setup one of our heavier and larger games. Also, since all information is open you can play the game solo, playing both sides.

<Close-up of game board>
There are a couple ways to set up the board, but what I have here is the “quick setup” with the USSR in red clustering on the right side of the board and the US with the blue units here in the center and some FAR off to the left, almost stranded. As an aside, I keep wanting to use the cardinal directions when talking about this map, but since this is the south pole, all directions are north; it’s confusing.

Each player goes through three phases in order:

Starvation
Actions
Doomsday Card resolution

Meaning your opponent is resolving the starvation phase after you take your actions, choosing the fate that you left your units to.

Let’s talk about each of these phases in order: starting with starvation.

Starvation 
The crux of the game is that each hex can only support so many units, normal hexes support 2, ice hexes support 3 and any hexes bordering a dead hex or the sea LOSING one support. These stack with each other but not themselves, so an ice hex bordering TWO dead hexes can support 2 units: <Use units to illustrate this>2 for base plus 1 for ice minus one for being dirty. During the starvation phase the current player resolves starvation for each hex: each unit that is in danger of starving either:

Flees to a friendly hex if there is one adjacent
Defects to an unfriendly hex, changing into a unit of the faction they’re defecting to
Dies, being removed from the map

In each of these situations if there are multiple hexes a unit can flee or deflect to the PHASING player determines which hex to move the unit into. Since starvation happens at the BEGINNING of a turn, this means the consequences of your actions are sometimes determined by your opponent.

Actions
Your action phase is meant to ensure that your units survive, neutral units defect to YOUR hexes and your units do not defect to your opponent.

During this phase you can move your units, convince neutral units to join your forces, force your opponent’s units to be pushed back or use your military units to kill other military units, but ultimately your goal is to keep your units on hexes that can support them and force your opponent to be stuck on or move to units that cannot support their population.

This can result in some hard and depressing decisions.

Once I starved two of my units so they wouldn’t defect to my opponent’s side.
While listening to the theme of “Papers Please”
Later, I forced my opponent to retreat into a hex that could NOT support them, forcing them to starve.

Doomsday Card
This is where two new hexes die, a group of neutral survivors show up and the next doomsday card is flipped. 

As the game progresses, the hexes listed on the cards will likely already be dead, so the CURRENT player gets to choose which of the hexes closest to the marked hex dies. Luckily you always see two face-up doomsday cards so you can plan ahead for your opponent’s doomsday and starvation phases.

<Face>

As the games nears the end things feel more and more desperate, the map encloses on you and you start to feel the specter of death looming and, as the number of available hexes to support your units diminish, It’s easy to forget that you can forfeit and your units will survive. And, because there are two doomsday cards face-up, you’ll find yourself in a situation where you KNOW you’re going to lose

The rules have a note saying: 

“There may come a point in the mid- to late-game where your opponent is guaranteed to win, or at least strongly favored to win. If this happens, the designer recommends that you forfeit with dignity. Your civilians surrender and become citizens of the victor. With the war finally behind them, this last remnant of humanity can shore up the coasts, stop the advancing meltwater, and fortify against the long winter to come.”

To add to this, in her design diaries which I’ll link in the description, Erin Escobedo mentions that the map can support all the units of population available to the players and that, if either player were to forfeit the game on turn one there would not need to be any suffering at all.

So, to quote the 1983 Matthew Broderick film “War Games”

“The only winning move is not to play”

And really that’s what this game is about. That’s why the rules start with that horrible quote from Gen. Thomas Power about having the literal last few men standing. War is dehumanizing and the “us” vs “them” mentality can be taken to such an extreme that you risk killing everyone, even yourself, just to ensure your opponent doesn’t win.

And, even if you do win, your people are destined to live the rest of their lives on a frozen wasteland surrounded by poisonous water until everyone dies of radiation poisoning or starvation I guess. It seems that there are no winners in meltwater, just someone who loses last.

I don’t think I’ve played a game with such a dark message that is still so fun; and this may even be part of the beauty of the game. You’re having fun checking the starvation phase and seeing who doesn’t make it this turn, you’re enjoying the strategy of killing off some units to ensure the rest survive, you revel in those turns where you push a bunch of your opponent’s units into scenarios where it’s impossible for them to survive.

Remove the theme and you have a great abstract game, but the theme is just perfect, allowing you to reflect on these decisions as something other than turns to win a game. Sure it’s dark you say to yourself, but they’re just pieces on a map, not real people….

Anyway, once this game is published again I’ll throw a link in the description because I truly suggest picking this game up. Keep an eye out for videos about Hollandspiele games in the future. I plan to cover both This Guilty Land and The Vote games by Amabel Holland.

Thanks for watching!
