# https://www.dandobrick.com/blog
Blog using jekyll that lives at [the above url](https://www.dandobrick.com/blog).

Theme taken from https://github.com/alainpham/alainpham.github.io, then modified a bunch.

## Drafts:

Create a draft: `thor draft:create "tile in quotes"`

Publish a draft: `thor draft:publish`

For more options see `thor help draft`

## Todo

### Probably
- [Update profile with github actions](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/)
- Change thor functions to be `thor draft publish` and `thor draft create`
- Once I have a handful of posts:
  - Setup something for categories
  - Add TIL category
  - If I end up having enough "real" blog posts
    - Add separate TIL page

### Maybe
- Get a generic image for "no_image" posts
- Update thor create function to allow for interactive mode (make default if there is no title)
- Make thor script executable
