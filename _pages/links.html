    I really like the idea of small websites/personal blogs, and I think that the web would be a better place if there were more of them.
    One good way of ensuring that <i>more</i> people see these small sites is to create links between them,
    so here are some links that I found intersesting and I hope you enjoy them! I've included a link to the blog and an article or two that I enjoyed.

  <p>
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I enjoyed the article linked and encourage you to explore these sites, but I did not vet them beyond reading an article or two and cannot guarantee their content.
    Don't take my linking to them as an endorsement of their entire site and/or the views espoused therein.
