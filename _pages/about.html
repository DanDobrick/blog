<h4>Who I am</h4>
<p>
  I'm a big proponent of starting off introductions with things that aren't about work, we're all people who live <a

    I'm a father of a wonderful {{ age }} year old boy.

<h4>Me as a Worker</h4>
<p>
  I mostly work with Ruby and Rails professionally, but love learning new technologies and expanding my tool belt.
</p>
<p>
  Writing software allows me to create something that will affect people's lives in positive ways while also learning
  new things each day. Coming from a background in education, I try to ensure that whatever I'm currently working on is
  intellectually stimulating while also bettering the lives of other people.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working as a software engineer for <a href="htps://www.mybrightwheel.com">Brightwheel</a> a vertical
  sass company for daycare providers.

  My resume lives at <a href="https://dandobrick.com/assets/Dan_Dobrick_resume_2023.pdf">this url</a> and I try to keep
  it updated, but that can be hard to do.
