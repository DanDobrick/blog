<h4>General Info</h4>
<strong>Name:</strong> Dan Dobrick

<strong>Location:</strong> Boulder, Co

<h4>Who I am</h4>
<p>
  I'm a big proponent of starting off introductions with things that aren't about work, we're all people who live <a
    href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sonder#Noun" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">interesting lives</a>
  after-all right?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    {% capture currentDate %}{{ site.time | date: '%s' }}{% endcapture %}
    {% assign birthDate = '04-03-2018 03:57:00' | date: '%s' %}
    {% assign ageInSeconds = currentDate | minus: birthDate %}
    {% assign age = ageInSeconds | divided_by: 31557600 %}
    I'm a father of a wonderful {{ age }} year old boy.

    I go rock climbing <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201108776/dan-d" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">on occasion</a> and have spent time in the many climbing areas around Colorado.

  <li>
    I love watching the Phillies and baseball in general.

  <li>
    I like board games and try to play as often as I can; either with a group or even solo. I've made a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unexploredgames6028" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">few youtube
      videos</a> about them and have started writing <a href="/unexplored-games/" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">posts about them</a> as well.

<h4>Me as a Worker</h4>
<p>
  I mostly work with Ruby and Rails professionally, but love learning new technologies and expanding my tool belt.
</p>
<p>
  Writing software allows me to create things that affect people's lives in positive ways while also learning
  each day. Coming from a background in education, I try to ensure that whatever I'm currently working on is
  intellectually stimulating while also bettering people's lives.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank"
    ref="nofollow noopener">Shopify</a> but my whole resume can be found <a href="https://dandobrick.com/assets/Dan_Dobrick_resume_2024.pdf" target="_blank"
    ref="nofollow noopener">here</a> and I try to keep
  it updated, (though that can be hard to do).
