<h4>General Info</h4>
<strong>Name:</strong> Dan Dobrick

<strong>Pronouns:</strong> He/Him

<strong>Location:</strong> Longmont, CO

<h4>Who I am</h4>
<p>
  I'm a big proponent of starting off introductions with things that aren't about work, we're all people who live <a
    href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sonder#Noun" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">interesting lives</a>
  after-all right?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I love watching the Phillies and baseball in general.

    {% assign birthDate = '04-03-2018 03:57:00' | date: '%s' %}
    {% assign ageInSeconds = currentDate | minus: birthDate %}
    {% assign age = ageInSeconds | divided_by: 31557600 %}
    I'm a father of a wonderful {{ age }} year old boy.
  </li>
  <li>
    I've started woodworking and enjoy making things with my hands; taking raw materials and turning them into something useful is a great feeling.
  </li>
  <li>
    I like board games and have even made a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unexploredgames6028" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">few youtube
      videos</a> and <a href="https://www.unexplored-games.com/blogs/game-reviews" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">blog posts</a> about them.
      I also have a very <a href="https://www.unexplored-games.com" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">small used game store</a> with <strong>free shipping</strong> if you're interested in checking that out.
  </li>
  <li>
    I go rock climbing <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201108776/dan-d" target="_blank" ref="nofollow noopener">a lot less than I used to</a>
    but I still love it and have spent time in the many climbing areas around Colorado.

</ul>

<h4>Me as a Worker</h4>
<p>
  I mostly work with Ruby and Rails professionally, but love learning new technologies and expanding my tool belt.
</p>
<p>
  Writing software allows me to create things that affect people's lives in positive ways while also learning
  every day. I have a background in education, so I try to ensure that whatever I'm currently working on is
  intellectually stimulating and allows me to grow as a person. I also think it's important to have a separation between work and
  life and tend to turn off my "work brain" when it's quitting time, but I'm known to have an epiphany or two while laying in bed or in the shower ðŸ˜†.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working as a senior software engineer at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank"
    ref="nofollow noopener">Shopify</a> but my whole resume can be found <a href="https://dandobrick.com/assets/Dan_Dobrick_resume_2024.pdf" target="_blank"
    ref="nofollow noopener">here</a> but it's hard to keep it up to date.
